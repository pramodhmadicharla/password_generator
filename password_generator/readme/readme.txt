This Python-based project is designed to enhance password management and security. It features a dynamic password generator that creates unique passwords based on user-specified lengths. The generated passwords are securely stored in a database for future reference. 

Key functionalities include:

1. **Password Generation**: Users can specify the desired length of the password, and the system will generate a strong, unique password accordingly.

2. **Password Strength Evaluation**: The application evaluates the strength of both newly generated and user-provided passwords, categorizing them as 'Strong,' 'Medium,' or 'Weak' based on established criteria.

3. **Database Storage**: Passwords are stored securely in a database, allowing for easy retrieval and management.

4. **Password Management**: Users have the option to delete saved passwords from the database as needed.

This project integrates core aspects of password security, including generation, evaluation, and management, offering a comprehensive tool for maintaining robust password practices.
